# POTATO_LEAVES_IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION_USING_CNN
Obtained an accuracy of 97% using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in tensorflow in classifying potato leaves into either healthy or early-blight or late-blight by analyzing over 2000+ images.
Data augumentation is performed for boosting the accuracy and so as to create a robust model.
Cache, Shuffle, Prefetch, Resizing and Normalization are performed and several other key insights are interpreted.
